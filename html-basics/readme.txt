 @abavatar sir is my mentor. 
 I am doing the Front End development So I need to know Html, Css, Javascript and  React-native.
 I need to follow the instruction which are as follows:
    a) I need to commit the 8 chapter. 
    b) Every chapter should be committed in 1 hour.
    c) I need to deploy every chapter in netlify.
I need to make the chapter with my own without any help of Internet.
Topic should be divided into chapter and I can develop as many chapter as my wish.
For any kind of suggestion or help I have three 15 minutes daily zoom call with  @sthirocean and with @Biengtharur I've two. and  in a week I have 15 minutes zoom call with @abavatar sir.
I can ask 10 queries from both @Biengtharur and @sthirocean and 2 queries from the @abavatar sir.  
Everyday I got a feedback from both @Biengtharur and @sthirocean and I need to execute them in the next morning.
@abavtar sir is montoring my quality of present understanding through out of my work that I have committed in the repo.
